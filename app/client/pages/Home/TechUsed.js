                This is a great starting point. A sweet intro to understanding components. The official docs are on point! If you have experience with writing directives in Angular,
                the transition is not really that bad. Server-side rendering, Lighterweight, and a new component router. A huge upgrade from V.1

                  Webpack is in essence a module bundler. Think of it as a Gulp, but specifically for large web apps. What the official doucmentation points out is for
                    big web apps "itâ€™s not efficient to put all code into a single file, especially if some blocks of code are only required under some circumstances". So Webpack
                    simply compiles your code into "fragments" which fits better with modularization. This makes it optimal for running libraries like React.

                This is a huge language library that ecompasses all things JavaScript. Want to run the latest and greatest version of JavaScript? No problem. TypeScript will
                compile all the "new hotness" down to plain JavaScript for you. This library goes hand in hand with the Angular 2/Ionic 2 development cycle. For me is a must know.

                Developed by Facebook. This is a JavaScript UI library that handles the View component in our Model-View-Controller software architecture. Written primarily in JSX, it forgoes the
                 expensive approach of rebuilding the DOM on data changes. Instead it efficiently updates and renders the targeted components.

                Now we are getting into things! React Native can run embedded instances of the JavaScriptCore inside a native mobile enviroment. It allows us to write mobile apps with pure JavaScript in React! It utilizes
                flexbox for layout, so there is no need to manually size your views in your app, which makes it easier to maintain and scale.

                  The intial launch of Ionic in 2013 brought attention to hybrid mobile app development. With a robust set of tools and services, in 2015 Ionic developers created over 1.3M apps.
                  Ionic 2 (still in beta) brings all of that and more to the table. More native functionality, built on top of Angular 2 and Apache Cordova makes for an easy and powerful
                  development cycle. They have some of the best documentation I've seen. You'll be up and running in no time.

                <h2 style={techTitle}>Cordova/Android plugins</h2>
                  This popular framework makes mobile developing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript possible. Supported on all platforms, Apache Cordova has enabled more Developers
                  to enter the mobile market. Which means that the majority of code you write for one platform, will be compatible with the next. With out it, Ionic and React Native would not have been feasible.

                  Is a set of wrappers for Cordova plugins, that makes it even easier to access any native functionality on your mobile device like GeoLocation or the Camera. With Node.js installed
                  you really just need to run <br/> <code>npm install ionic --save</code> from the command line in your project directory. Easy as that!
